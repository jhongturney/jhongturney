# 👋 Hi/Hello/Howdy, I'm [Jason](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhongturney) 🤠

👷‍♂️ I work in Platform Operations at GitHub doing what I can to improve service uptime and resiliency!

### ⚡️ _Quick Facts_ ⚡️
🧑🏻‍💻 I have an extensive background with VMware technologies, but am working with Azure and Kubernetes these days 🪄

🧑🏻‍💻 I've written a lot of automation with PowerShell, but I'm learning other things all the time 📚

☕ I work best when caffienated (favorite: Sugar-free vanilla almond milk latte)

🎮 I play games to relax, but I prefer single-player over online multi-player...
